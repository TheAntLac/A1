The way to navigate through the code should be simple, but the most important part
would be to ONLY use numbers, as that's all it needs to be used.

It'll start by reading the file and putting it into an array as it then prompts
a menu up. These Screenshots ahead of this message will display what could be done.

letting you find, modify, add, delete/turn 0, or exit altogether.
